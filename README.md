# Aim

The objective of this project is to develop a robust and user-friendly clothing style transfer system that can seamlessly transfer garments from one person to another. By leveraging recent advancements in computer vision, image processing, and deep learning techniques, our proposed system will enable users to experiment with different clothing styles, borrow garments virtually, and create personalized fashion statements.
